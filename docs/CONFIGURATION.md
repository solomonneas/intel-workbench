# Configuration

## Frontend Configuration

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```bash
VITE_APP_PORT=5182
VITE_STORAGE_KEY=intel-workbench-projects
VITE_ENABLE_TOUR=true
VITE_THEME_DEFAULT=v3
```

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `VITE_APP_PORT` | Frontend port | 5182 |
| `VITE_STORAGE_KEY` | localStorage key for projects | intel-workbench-projects |
| `VITE_ENABLE_TOUR` | Show guided tour on first visit | true |
| `VITE_THEME_DEFAULT` | Default variant on first load | v3 (Analyst) |

## Theme Variants

Access Intel Workbench variants directly:

- `http://localhost:5182/` - Variant selector landing page
- `http://localhost:5182/v1/*` - Langley (Intelligence Agency)
- `http://localhost:5182/v2/*` - Terminal (Hacker/OSINT)
- `http://localhost:5182/v3/*` - Analyst's Desk (Clean Professional)
- `http://localhost:5182/v4/*` - Stratcom (Military Command)
- `http://localhost:5182/v5/*` - Cyber Noir (Cyberpunk)

Your last-used variant is saved and loaded automatically on next visit.

## Running the Application

### Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Starts on `http://localhost:5182`

Hot reload enabled. Changes to components, styles, and configuration are instant.

### Production Build

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

Outputs to `dist/` directory. Serve with any static file server:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8080 --directory dist
# or
npx serve dist
```

## Data Storage

### localStorage Keys

Intel Workbench stores all analysis data in browser localStorage:

| Key | Purpose | Typical Size |
|-----|---------|--------------|
| `intel-workbench-projects` | All projects, hypotheses, evidence, bias notes | 0.5-5MB |
| `intel-workbench-theme-preference` | Last-used variant (v1-v5) | <1KB |

No network calls. All data is local.

### Maximum Storage

Most modern browsers provide 5-10MB per domain. Intel Workbench uses minimal overhead, allowing:
- 100-200 complete intelligence analysis projects
- 1,000+ individual evidence items
- Full audit trail of analysis work

For larger deployments, export old projects to JSON and clear localStorage.

## Project Backup and Restore

### Exporting a Project

1. Open project
2. Click **Export Page** tab
3. Choose format:
   - **JSON** - Full backup with all metadata
   - **Markdown** - Formatted report for sharing
   - **Text** - Plain text summary

### Exporting All Projects

From the Home page, click **Settings** to access bulk export:

```javascript
// Manually export all projects
const store = useProjectStore.getState();
const backup = JSON.stringify(store.projects);
// Save to file or send to server
```

### Importing a Project

1. From Home page, click **Import**
2. Select JSON file from previous export
3. Choose to append or replace existing projects
4. Confirm import

### URL-Based Sharing

Export encodes project JSON in URL hash:

1. Open project
2. Click **Export**
3. Choose **Share Link** (if available)
4. Copy URL
5. Share with colleague

Recipient opens link, project loads from hash into localStorage. No server required.

## Bias Checklist Configuration

The 12 biases are built-in and not configurable. To customize:

Edit `src/data/biasData.ts`:

```typescript
export const BIASES = [
  {
    id: 'anchoring',
    category: 'Cognitive',
    name: 'Anchoring Bias',
    description: 'Over-reliance on initial information...',
    questions: [
      'Are we anchored to an initial estimate?',
      'Would alternative data lead to different conclusion?',
    ],
  },
  // ...
];
```

## Scoring Configuration

To adjust ACH scoring weights, edit `src/utils/achScoring.ts`:

```typescript
export const CREDIBILITY_MULTIPLIERS = {
  'High': 1.5,
  'Medium': 1.0,
  'Low': 0.5,
};

export const RELEVANCE_MULTIPLIERS = {
  'High': 1.5,
  'Medium': 1.0,
  'Low': 0.5,
};

export const RATING_VALUES = {
  'C': -1,    // Consistent
  'I': 2,     // Inconsistent (penalized)
  'N': 0,     // Neutral
  'NA': 0,    // Not Applicable
};
```

Default weights follow Heuer's original ACH methodology. Adjust based on your organization's standards.

## Guided Tour Configuration

First-time users see an interactive tour powered by driver.js. To customize:

Edit `src/components/GuidedTour.tsx`:

```typescript
const tourSteps = [
  {
    element: '.project-list',
    popover: {
      title: 'Your Projects',
      description: 'Create and manage intelligence analysis projects here...',
    },
  },
  // Add or remove steps
];
```

To disable tour for all users:

```bash
VITE_ENABLE_TOUR=false npm run dev
```

Or programmatically:

```typescript
useProjectStore.setState({ tourCompleted: true });
```

## Browser Compatibility

Intel Workbench requires:
- Modern browser with ES2020 support
- localStorage enabled (required for offline operation)
- 5MB+ localStorage quota

Tested on:
- Chrome/Edge 90+
- Firefox 88+
- Safari 14+
- Mobile browsers (iOS Safari 14+, Chrome Android 90+)

## Performance Optimization

### For Large Projects

If you have 500+ evidence items:

1. **Split into sub-projects** - One project per major hypothesis or timeframe
2. **Archive old projects** - Export to JSON and delete from localStorage
3. **Use Markdown export** - Share results without localStorage overhead
4. **Clear browser data** - Periodically clean up localStorage

### Storage Quota

Monitor storage usage:

```javascript
// In browser console
navigator.storage.estimate().then(estimate => {
  console.log(`Usage: ${estimate.usage} bytes`);
  console.log(`Quota: ${estimate.quota} bytes`);
});
```

If nearing quota:
1. Export projects to JSON
2. Delete oldest projects from localStorage
3. Import as needed

### Batch Operations

For editing many items:

1. Export project to JSON
2. Edit JSON in text editor
3. Re-import

Faster than clicking through the UI for bulk updates.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

Enable in settings (coming soon). Current bindings:

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `Tab` | Move between cells in ACH matrix |
| `Shift+Tab` | Move backward between cells |
| `Enter` | Open rating menu for current cell |
| `Escape` | Close menus and dialogs |
| `Ctrl+S` / `Cmd+S` | Export current project (browser save dialog) |

## Multi-Device Sync

Intel Workbench stores data locally with no built-in sync. To use across devices:

1. **Export on Device A** - JSON export
2. **Transfer file** - Email, cloud storage, USB drive
3. **Import on Device B** - Import JSON file

Or manually manage via cloud storage:
1. Export to OneDrive/Google Drive/Dropbox
2. Keep a master backup in the cloud
3. Import to any device as needed

For automatic sync, consider pairing with a custom backend (not included).

## Troubleshooting

### Data Not Saving

Verify localStorage is enabled and you haven't hit quota:

```javascript
// Check quota
navigator.storage.estimate().then(e => console.log(e));

// Clear and try again
localStorage.removeItem('intel-workbench-projects');
// Reload page and create a new project
```

### Projects Disappearing

Most likely cause: Browser cleared storage (automatic cleanup, incognito mode closure, or cache clear).

Prevention:
1. Regularly export projects to JSON
2. Keep backups in cloud storage
3. Use persistent browser (not incognito)

### Slow Scoring

With 500+ evidence items, scoring may take 100-500ms. This is expected.

Workarounds:
1. Split into multiple projects
2. Remove low-relevance evidence
3. Archive completed analysis

Contact support if scoring takes >1 second for normal projects.
